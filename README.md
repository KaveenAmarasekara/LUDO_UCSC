LUDO like UCSC
-----------------------------------

LUDO is a board game for two (2) to four (4) players inspired by the ancient Indian cross and circle board game Pachisi. Ludo differs from Pachisi by including six (6) sided dice to make moves on the Ludo board. The structure of the Ludo board is given in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, the traditional LUDO board consists of multiple areas and cells that enable the dynamics of the game. The areas of the board are as follows:

• There are a maximum of four (4) players in the game, and each player is assigned a colour as Red (R), Yellow (Y), Green (G), and Blue (B).

• Each player has a base of its colour and has four pieces named 1 to 4. For example, the four Green pieces are named G1, G2, G3, and G4.

• Each piece is placed at the base at the beginning of the game, and when the player can move a piece from the base, it will be first moved to the cell marked with an ‘X’ of the respective colour.

• There are 52 standard and 20 colour-specific cells on the board. The standard cells include the cells marked with a coloured circle and the coloured cells marked with an ‘X’. The colour-specific cells are the five cells for each colour that connects to ‘Home’.

• The five coloured cells connecting to ‘Home’ are called the ‘Home Straight’ for that colour.

• The coloured circles beneath the colour-specific ‘Home straight’ is called the ‘Approach’ cell. This cell marks the point where a colour-specific piece can move from the standard cells to the home straight.

• Each piece starts from its respective base and moves through the board to its respective home. When a piece reaches home, the piece is removed from the game.
